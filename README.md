## Origin (to be reviewed)

This is a Hugo theme I originally built for my personal website back in January 2020 (see this post for more details about my initial motivations). I decided to put more effort to it in September 2023 to make it better and share it on Hugo Themes. I did no, I work again on 2025.

We I designed this website I wanted a layout with two navigation bars (one on each side), no header and no footer (on large and medium screens). I wanted a site relatively light, so I did not rely on frameworks (such as bootstrap), I did the reactivity myself (hopefully it works as desired!) and I tried to rely as much as possible on native Hugo features. To be fair, I still load tow icon sets, KaTeX and two very small js scripts of my own.
